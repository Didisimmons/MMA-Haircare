Ayo Recipes is a modern recipe sharing website that caters to people of all ages. Its mission is to provide users with luxury cuisine food recipes in the comfort of their own home, eliminating the stress associated with pre-cooking.  At Ayo Recipes, we understand the hassle of cooking as well as the thought process involved in deciding on a specific meal to prepare .

Ayo Recipes provides users with simple recipes shared by our members, as well as coupons for kitchenware that makes cooking easier and more enjoyable. The user can easily search for a recipe category/recipe name, view its content, and order the meal from the page; however, the user must login/register to the site in order to see the order button, access cooking tips and tricks, and create their own recipe.

The goal of the site is for the user to be able to perform basic CRUD functionality(Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on the site and interact with it intuitively, having  a positive experience.

- Individuals who are interested in food and enjoy cooking. 

### **RESEARCH**   
To get some UX inspiration for Ayo, I researched other recipe sharing websites like To get some UX inspiration for Ayo, I researched other recipe sharing websites like
1. [Yummly](https://www.yummly.co.uk/)
2. [Bbcgoodfood](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/)
3. [Epicurious](https://www.epicurious.com/) 
4. Similar recipe sharing sites created by other Code Institute peers (searched in the Slack channel peer-code-review) were examined. 

To gain a design understanding of what these sites have in common and how Ayo Recipes can improve their own service by addressing the problems associated with recipe sharing sites. According to research, these sites appeared to be a bit overwhelming and were packed with a lot of information that bombarded the user as to where to start, potentially leading to users abandoning the site.

Ayo Recipes is a fun modern recipe sharing platform that considers the aforementioned issues. The site has been evenly spaced and kept clean in order for the user to easily navigate through the various pages without feeling overwhelmed. The admin manages the site's information, which is regularly updated to keep it up to date and to ensure that the UX is consistent across all pages and that all links work

## **DESIGN**   
### **Color Scheme**   
The colours used in the design of Ayo Recipes were created using the [Adobe Color site](https://color.adobe.com/search?q=recipe&t=term). The colours were handpicked and researched to ensure that they communicated to our users subconsciously. 

[Jen David](https://jenndavid.com/colors-that-influence-food-sales-infographic/) has provided us with a colour chart that can influence your gourmet industry business and has been used in the colour selection for Ayo Recipes. The colours reflect the Ayo Recipes brand in order to build trust with users and stimulate their taste buds by using bright colours (yellow and orange) to catch our users' attention and brown/white to give it a warm, welcoming, and clean look. <br/>
![The color scheme](static/images/readme/colorpalette.png "The color scheme")  

### **Typography**  
The fonts were sourced from .   
The [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) Dancing Script and Poppins are used on the website to ensure consistency and to give the site a distinct and friendly look similar to other recipe sharing websites. The two fonts are appealing to our target audience, and a backup font has been included called sans-serif

### **Imagery**  
The photos on the site were obtained from a free image provider [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), and the recipe images were obtained from bbcgoodfood, Yummly, and epicurious. 

The photographs depict modern cuisine dishes that can be prepared in the comfort of one's own home. The images' purpose is to attract users' attention to the Ayo Recipe website, where they can login/register to create their own recipes.

### **Database Structure** 
MongoDB was chosen as the database for this project due to the flexibility it offers for non-relational data. [Diagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home) was used to create the data schema for this project. Our schema had three collections: 
* Users
* Categories
* Recipes

# **Features**  
## **Existing Features** 

### **GENERAL FEATURES ON ALL PAGES :**  
   - Each page is fully responsive on all pages and has been designed to be extremely user-friendly.

   - **Navigation Bar** - On all pages of Ayo Recipes, there is a fully responsive navigation bar. When the brand logo in the upper left corner is clicked, it takes the user to the homepage. The menu items on the left collapse to a hamburger icon when the width of the website is reduced to a smaller device, such as a mobile device. The user can easily click the icon to view Ayo Recipes' side nav bar and swipe left to hide it.
      * When a guest user visits the site, they will notice the following menu items at the top right: (Recipes, Create Recipes, Login, Register ) 
      * Members who are logged in can access the following menu items: (Recipes, Profile, Tips & Tricks, Logout), which allow them to create, edit, and delete recipes as well as receive discounts on kitchenwares.
      * When an admin user logs in, they see the same menu items as registered users, but there is an additional menu item that states "Manage categories.".

   - **Flash Messages** - When a user performs a basic CRUD function, flash messages appear on all pages to provide feedback on the action they performed. 

   - **Recipe Card containers** - Throughout the site, recipe card containers have been used to display the recipe image, name, and description in an orderly and appealing manner. The user can view more information about the recipes by clicking on the images in the card

   - **Footer** - The footer section contains Ayo Recipes' social media handles, where users can learn more about them in order to build trust with the brand and confirm business legitimacy. It also includes some additional links to cooking-related information.

   - **Defensive back-end programming** - There has been some back-end defensive programming to prevent users from accessing pages/functions that they are not permitted to access. For example, when a user views a single recipe, they cannot see the " ORDER NOW " button but can see the "BACK" button; however, if the user registers/logs in, they can see the "ORDER NOW" button if they are viewing a recipe that was not created by them.  

   - **Modal** - A modal appears on some pages for the user to perform the delete functionality.

### **FEATURES OF EACH PAGE**     

   - **Home Page**

      The hero image is located beneath the responsive navigation bar and serves to draw the user's attention. The header text has a zoom in effect that welcomes the user to the site, as well as a static tag line text that is visually appealing. 

      Under the header is a festive container with a brief summary of Ayo Recipes and three recipe containers with the highest star-rated recipes.

      The recipe containers allow the user to view the various categories of recipes available on the site. The user can view each recipe by clicking on any of the category names. 

      Following the categories section, the user can scroll down to see where they can buy cheaper kitchen decors that make cooking much easier.

### **FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT IN FUTURE**  

1. Forgot password functionality: This would allow users to change their passwords if they forgot them without having to create a new account each time they forgot their password. 

2. Pagination : As the number of recipes in the database grows, pagination should be added to the recipes and view category pages for a better user experience. 

3. A save recipe function that allows registered users to save recipes created by other members to their profile would be ideal. The saved recipes would appear on the registered user's profile alongside recipes created by them.

4. Profile picture: When a user creates an account, there should be a dropdown of images from which the user can choose an Ayo Recipes profile image. When the image is selected and the user is logged in, the profile image and the user's name should appear at the top of the profile page.

5.  The admin user should be given more powers, such as the ability to manage user information by editing or deleting it.

6. A public profile page where registered users can view information about other members as well as recipes they've created. Users should be able to leave reviews on each other's profile pages if any of the recipes they created have been attempted.

7. An e-cart that allows users to order recipes directly from the page rather than through a third-party link. On their profile page, registered users can post recipes and sell food items.

# **Testing**  
The testing documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/dissyulina/cookle-cookbook/blob/main/TESTING.md#cookle---testing). 

<br/>   
  
# **Deployment**   
This project was created with Gitpod as the IDE and is hosted on Github because Github Pages cannot host a Python project. This project was deployed using a free hosting service (Heroku).  

## **Deployment to Heroku**   
To deploy our project to Heroku we linked our GitHub repository to Heroku ands followed the following steps.    

1. **Create a new Heroku App**   
   * Sign in or create an account with Heroku. Select "Create new app" in the top right corner of your dashboard after logging in   
   * Provide a unique app name and use a hyphen between words.   
   * Choose a region that is close to you and then click Create App.  

2. **Create the following important files**   
   * Return to your project's Gitpod IDE and create a gitignore and an env.py file.
   * The env.py file would contain all of the environment variables required to connect our MongoDB database to our Heroku App.
   * To hide the sensitive information it contains, such as the secret key and our unique mongo DB URI, the env.py file must be added to the gitignore file.
   * Make a file called **"requirements.txt"** that contains a list of all the Python dependencies for our project. This tells Heroku what language is being used. To make this file, type the following into the terminal.   
      ```pipi3 freeze --local > requirements.txt```   
   * Next, in the terminal, type the following to create a "Procfile" that instructs Heroku on how to run our project:   
      ```echo web: python run.py > Procfile```
   * This tells Heroku that our application will be a web process, and the command to run it is **"python app.py."**  

3. **Link our Git repository to Heroku**   
   * Return to our Heroku Dashboard and choose "deploy" from the top options. 
   * Select "GitHub" from the deployment method from section.   
   * This gives you an input field where you can search for your GitHub repository by name. When the correct repository, in our case "Ayo Recipes," is found, click "Connect."   
   * After that, we need to set up the necessary environment variables in our Heroku App's env.py file.
   * Click "Settings" on the Heroku Dashboard and then the "Reveal Config Vars" button.
   * The following key value pairs should be  added:   
      |Key|Value|
      |----|----|
      |IP|0.0.0.0|
      |PORT|5000|
      |SECRET_KEY|```<your_secret_key>```|
      |MONGO_URI|```mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster_name>-ocous.mongodb.net/<database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority```|
      |MONGO_DBNAME|```<database_name>```|
      
4. **Enable Automatic Deployment**   
   * Return to the dashboard and click "Deploy" once we've configured our environment variables. Scroll down to "Automatic Deployments" and click "Enable Automatic Deployment."  
   * We have the "Manual deploy" section under "Automatic deploys." From our main branch, click the "Deploy Branch" button.   
   * Once this is completed, Heroku will build our app with all of the necessary packages. To view the website, go to the top right corner and select "Open App". 


### **STEPS TO USE THIS PROJECT** 
The MongoDb atlas was used to store the data in this project. The steps below were taken to create our database and connect it to our Heroku App.

### **1. Create database on MongoDB**  
1. **Set Up MongoDB**   
   * To begin visit the mongoDB website and creating an account/login.
   * Create a cluster by selecting a shared cluster once you've logged in.
   * Choose a cloud provider. AWS was chosen for this project and is ideal for its requirements.
   * When that option is selected. Choose a "Cluster Tier" and the M0 Tier (Free forever tier).
   * Once you've completed all of the preceding steps, click the "Create Cluster" button.
   * To create our database user credentials, navigate to 'Database Access' under the Security section on our mongoDB dashboard.
     - Create a username and password using the default SCRAM authentication method by clicking 'Add New Database User.' (It is recommended that you use a combination of letters and numbers to avoid any problems.  
     - The username and password that we specify here will be used in our MONGO URI environment variable  
     - Finally, configure the "Database User Privileges" to allow read and write access to any database, and then click "Add User."  
   
   * After we've added the user, Go to the dashboard's Security menu and select "Network Access" to whitelist our IP address and ensure that it has access to our database.    
   *  Select "Allow Access from Anywhere" after clicking "Add IP Address." Normally, you would enter your website's IP address, but we chose this option because the database will be accessed via our gitpod workspace and Heroku
   * Then press the "Confirm" button.

We can now create our database after we have set up MongoDB. The database was built using the Ayo Recipes [Data Scheme](static/images/readme/database-schema.png "Database schema").    

2. **Create database**    
   * Select the Cluster tab, then select the "Collections" button.  
   * Since we aren’t uploading an existing dataset, select "Create Database."  
   * Provide the name of your database and one initial collection that will be used for your project. 
   * After we've done that, we can add more collections to our database by clicking the "Create Collection" button.
   * We can manually create a document by selecting one of the collections and clicking the "insert document" button in the upper right corner. 

### **2. Fork or Clone The Github Repository**   

#### **Forking The GitHub Repository**  
By forking the GitHub repository, we create a clone of our original repository (AYO RECIPES) in our GitHub account. By cloning our project we can make  modifications and experiments on the cloned repository without affecting the original repository.   

1. Sign In to GitHub account .  
2. Decide from the list of repositories which you would want to be duplicated. For this project it's AYO RECIPES .  
3. Locate the "fork" option at the top right corner of the AYO RECIPES and click it. Once clicked it creates another copy of the AYO RECIPES repository to accommodate modifications.  

#### **Making A Local Clone**     
1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Locate the desired repository to clone which in this case is “AYO RECIPES” .
3. At the top of AYO RECIPES repository page,  Locate the “Code” button at the top  and click it. Copy the HTTPS link that appears.
4. Activate your local IDE terminal.
5. In the terminal, type “git clone” and then paste the link copied from HTTPS.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```
6. Press “Enter” and your local clone has been created.


# **Credits**  
### **CONTENT**  
1. The site's design was inspired by extensive research conducted on recipe sharing websites such as [yummly](https://www.yummly.co.uk/), [bbcgoodfood](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/) , [epicurious](https://www.epicurious.com/) and other MS3 peer's project(slack channel).  

2. Photoshop was used to create the Ayo Recipes brand logo.
      
3.	The animation effect used on the hero image header text was obtained from the [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/animation/)  website. 

4. Abdul Basit's [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLBLsxcB3Dc) assistance was used to create the dynamic form fields in the add-recipe page code.

5. The code from Code Institute's mini project lesson on Task Manager Application was primarily used as a reference and guide for developing the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionalities for this project. 

6. Another peer's [project](https://github.com/dissyulina/cookle-cookbook/blob/main/app.py#L433) here at code institute provided code assistance for the creation of the edit profile and add recipe functions.

7. Research on StackOverflow and Jinja documentation aided in the creation of some  Python functions and the application of the Jinja template. 

8. [Code pen](https://codepen.io/t_afif/pen/eYWJNBd) was used to generate the html and CSS code for the star rating applied on the add recipe page.  

9. The code for the star rating on the single page was also obtained from another peer's project here at [code institute](https://github.com/mosull20/dark-side-ms3/blob/main/templates/profile.html) which aided in the design.

10. The code used to force resize some images while maintaining the same aspect ratio was obtained from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12991351/css-force-image-resize-and-keep-aspect-ratio). 

11. The external links relating to kitchenware discounts included in the tips & tricks page were obtained [Countryliving](https://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/g32869067/chef-pantry-staples/?slide=1), [Delish](https://www.delish.com/food/a52476/kitchen-pantry-organization-ideas/) , [Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/michelleno/cooking-tips-for-beginners) and [Bbcgoodfood](http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/). 

12. Majority of the recipes added to the AYO Recipes database come from recipe sharing websites like [yummly](https://www.yummly.co.uk/), [delicious](delicious.com.au), [bbcgoodfood](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/) as do the recipe images.

13. This readme was based on research on several readme documents, including the Code Institute's readme [sample](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/SampleREADME), the dark side's readme [sample](https://github.com/mosull20/dark-side-ms3#deployment),  Cookle's readMe's [sample](https://github.com/dissyulina/cookle-cookbook#deployment-to-heroku), FLYBOY's readMe [file](https://github.com/Didisimmons/LILELI-QUIZ-GAME/blob/main/test.md) and LILELI's readME's [file](https://github.com/Didisimmons/LILELI-QUIZ-GAME/blob/main/readME.md).
